Stirfry parses the Gracie's Weekly Menus site for days when stir fry are available.

Files:
-----
stir-fry.sh :: grabs the menu and dumps it to the stirfry directory for parsing, then calls the perl script.
stir-fry.pl :: parses the perl script
stirfry.js  :: javascript for highlighting the correct day & telling you if there is stir fry right now.

Usage: Run stirfry.sh as a cronjob every Sunday at midnight (0 0 * * 0). Change the absolute paths in stir-fry.sh and stir-fry.pl to match your web server directory.
